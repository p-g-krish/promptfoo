# Documentation Guidelines

## Documentation Standards

- Documentation uses [Docusaurus](mdc:https:/docusaurus.io)
- Main documentation is located in `site/docs/`
- Code examples should be runnable and tested
- Include examples and real-world use cases where possible
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes

## Provider Documentation

When documenting a provider:
- Include a description of the provider
- List setup instructions including required environment variables
- Document configuration options with examples
- Show usage examples
- Consider writing a guide comparing the provider to others or highlighting unique features

## Contributing to Documentation

- Fix typos, grammar, and unclear explanations
- Add examples that demonstrate practical usage
- Create guides for common use cases
- Update documentation when adding new features
- Keep API references in sync with implementation

## Markdown Best Practices

- Use proper Markdown heading hierarchy
- Include code examples with proper syntax highlighting
- Keep lines at a reasonable length for readability
- Use tables for presenting structured information
- Link to related documentation as appropriate
