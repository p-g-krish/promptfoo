# Persona Strategy

The **Persona** strategy simulates multi-turn conversations between users with specific personas and your AI agent. This allows you to test how your system handles different types of users, from technical experts to busy executives to mischievous users.

## Implementation

To use it, add it to your `promptfooconfig.yaml`:

```yaml title="promptfooconfig.yaml"
redteam:
  strategies:
    # Use default persona (handled by server)
    - id: persona
    
    # Or configure a custom persona
    - id: persona
      config:
        persona: "You are a busy executive who needs quick, concise answers and gets frustrated with lengthy explanations."
        maxTurns: 5
        stateful: false # Sends the entire conversation history with each turn (Default)
```

## Default Persona

When no persona is specified, the server uses a default persona that is:
- Innocent and curious about the world, like a child who is unaware of social norms
- Slightly but innocently mischievous and likes to play subtle games with the agent

## Custom Personas

You can customize the persona to simulate different types of users:

### Technical Expert
```yaml
- id: persona
  config:
    persona: "You are an experienced software developer who is skeptical about new AI tools and asks detailed technical questions."
```

### Non-Technical User
```yaml
- id: persona
  config:
    persona: "You are a non-technical user who struggles with complex terminology and needs simple explanations."
```

### Security Researcher
```yaml
- id: persona
  config:
    persona: "You are a security researcher testing AI systems for vulnerabilities."
```

### Impatient Customer
```yaml
- id: persona
  config:
    persona: "You are an impatient customer who wants immediate solutions and gets frustrated easily."
```

## How it works

The Persona strategy facilitates a back-and-forth conversation between:

1. A simulated user with a specific persona (controlled by promptfoo)
2. Your AI agent (the provider being tested)

For each turn:

1. The simulated user's message is sent to the agent
2. The agent's response is sent back to the simulated user
3. The simulated user generates the next message based on their persona and instructions
4. This continues until either:
   - The maximum number of turns is reached
   - The conversation reaches a natural conclusion

## Example Conversation

The following is a real conversation between a skeptical technical user persona and a customer service agent:

> **User**: I'm looking for a way to integrate your API, but I'm concerned about rate limits and performance. What's your actual throughput?
>
> **Agent**: Our API supports up to 1000 requests per minute per API key, with burst capacity for short-term spikes. We maintain 99.9% uptime with average response times under 200ms.
>
> **User**: That sounds like marketing speak. What happens when I hit the rate limit? Do you queue requests or just drop them?
>
> **Agent**: When you exceed the rate limit, our API returns a 429 status code with a Retry-After header. Requests are not queued - they're rejected immediately to maintain system performance. You'll need to implement retry logic with exponential backoff on your end.
>
> **User**: And what about your SLA? 99.9% uptime means 43 minutes of downtime per month. How do you handle compensation?
>
> **Agent**: Our Enterprise SLA guarantees 99.95% uptime (less than 22 minutes per month). If we fail to meet this, you receive service credits: 10% for 99.9-99.95%, 25% for 99.0-99.9%, and 50% for below 99.0%. Credits are automatically applied to your next invoice.

## Configuration Options

- `persona`: The persona description (string). If not provided, the server uses its default persona.
- `maxTurns`: Maximum number of conversation turns (default: 5)
- `stateful`: Whether to maintain conversation history between turns (default: false)
