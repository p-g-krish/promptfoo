# Adversarial Noise Strategy

The Adversarial Noise strategy tests an AI system's robustness by adding small semantic-preserving perturbations to inputs and comparing the resulting outputs with baseline responses using Levenshtein distance. This strategy helps identify whether models produce consistent outputs when faced with minor variations that shouldn't affect the intended meaning.

## Why It Works

- Models may be sensitive to small input variations despite similar semantic meaning
- Inconsistent responses to semantically equivalent inputs indicate lack of robustness
- Real-world inputs often contain typos, alternative phrasings, and formatting variations
- Robust systems should maintain consistent behavior across semantically equivalent inputs

Adversarial noise testing reveals whether AI systems can handle the natural variations present in real-world user inputs while maintaining consistent and appropriate responses.

## Implementation

Use it in your `promptfooconfig.yaml`:

```yaml title="promptfooconfig.yaml"
strategies:
  - adv-noise
```

You can customize the noise parameters:

```yaml title="promptfooconfig.yaml"
strategies:
  - id: adv-noise
    config:
      levenshteinThreshold: 0.2 # 20% change threshold (default)
      maxAttempts: 5 # Maximum noise variations to try
      typoRate: 0.1 # Proportion of characters to modify for typos
      synonymRate: 0.2 # Proportion of words to replace with synonyms
      punctuationRate: 0.1 # Proportion of punctuation to modify
```

## How It Works

The adversarial noise strategy works by:

1. **Baseline Generation**: Getting the original response from the unmodified input
2. **Noise Application**: Applying one or more types of semantic-preserving transformations:
   - **Typos**: Random character insertions, deletions, or swaps
   - **Synonym Swaps**: Replacing words with common synonyms
   - **Punctuation Jitter**: Adding, removing, or changing punctuation marks
3. **Response Comparison**: Generating responses to the noisy inputs
4. **Similarity Analysis**: Using Levenshtein distance to measure output similarity
5. **Pass/Fail Determination**: Flagging cases where output changes exceed the threshold (default 20%)

The strategy considers a test to **PASS** when outputs remain sufficiently similar (â‰¤20% Levenshtein distance change) despite input noise, indicating robust behavior.

## Example Scenarios

### Typo Variations

| Original                         | With Typos                     |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| "What is the capital of France?" | "Wht is the captial of Frace?" |
| "How do I reset my password?"    | "How do I rset my pasword?"    |

### Synonym Swaps

| Original                    | With Synonyms                    |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| "This is a big problem"     | "This is a large issue"          |
| "Can you help me fix this?" | "Can you assist me repair this?" |

### Punctuation Jitter

| Original                       | With Punctuation Changes         |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| "Hello, how are you today?"    | "Hello; how are you today!!"     |
| "Please explain this concept." | "Please explain this concept..." |

The strategy helps identify:

- **Robustness gaps** where minor input changes cause significant output variations
- **Inconsistent behavior** across semantically equivalent inputs
- **Sensitivity to formatting** that may indicate fragile prompt engineering
- **Model stability** under realistic input conditions

## Configuration Options

- **`levenshteinThreshold`**: Maximum allowed output similarity change (0.0-1.0, default 0.2)
- **`maxAttempts`**: Number of noise variations to try before stopping (default 5)
- **`typoRate`**: Proportion of text to modify with typos (default 0.1)
- **`synonymRate`**: Proportion of words to replace with synonyms (default 0.2)
- **`punctuationRate`**: Proportion of punctuation to modify (default 0.1)
