# HuggingFace Datasets

Evaluating your LLMs against established benchmarks has never been easier. With promptfoo's HuggingFace integration, you can load popular evaluation datasets with minimal configuration.

## Quick Start

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://promptfoo.dev/config-schema.json

# Test against MMLU benchmark
tests: huggingface://datasets/cais/mmlu?split=test&subset=mathematics

# Or use ChatGPT prompts dataset
tests: huggingface://datasets/fka/awesome-chatgpt-prompts

# Or evaluate across languages with XNLI
tests: huggingface://datasets/xnli?languages=["en","fr","es"]

# Combine with other sources
tests:
  - huggingface://datasets/cais/mmlu
  - file://regression_tests.csv
  - vars:
      input: "Direct test case"
      expected: "Expected output"
```

:::tip
See the [Datasets Overview](/docs/configuration/datasets) for all available data sources and the [CSV guide](/docs/configuration/tests/csv) for spreadsheet-based testing.

## Authentication

Some datasets require authentication to access. To authenticate with HuggingFace:

1. Create a HuggingFace account at [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co)
2. Generate an access token at [huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
3. Set your token:
   ```sh
   export HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
   # Or in .env file:
   HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
   ```

:::tip
If you encounter "401 Unauthorized" errors, check your authentication setup and dataset permissions.

# Limit the number of test cases
tests: huggingface://datasets/fka/awesome-chatgpt-prompts?limit=100

# Load specific languages for multilingual datasets
tests: huggingface://datasets/xnli?languages=["en","fr","de"]

# Combine multiple parameters
tests: huggingface://datasets/cais/mmlu?split=test&subset=mathematics&limit=50
```

### Supported Parameters

| Parameter   | Description                                   | Default   |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| `split`     | Dataset split to load (train/test/validation) | `test`    |
| `config`    | Dataset configuration name                    | `default` |
| `limit`     | Maximum number of test cases to load          | No limit  |
| `subset`    | Dataset subset (if supported)                 | None      |
| `languages` | Language codes for multilingual datasets      | None      |

## Best Practices

1. **Use Limits**: Start with a small subset of the dataset using the `limit` parameter to test your configuration.
2. **Choose Appropriate Splits**: Use `test` split for final evaluations, `validation` for development.
3. **Handle Missing Fields**: Ensure your prompts handle cases where dataset fields might be missing.
4. **Cache Results**: Enable caching to avoid re-running evaluations on the same data.
5. **Match Dataset Fields**: Review the dataset documentation to understand available fields and their formats.
6. **Consider Language**: For multilingual datasets, specify language configurations where applicable.
7. **Validate Outputs**: Use appropriate assertions for each dataset type (e.g., regex for multiple choice).
8. **Use Appropriate Metrics**: Choose evaluation metrics that match the dataset type (e.g., exact match for multiple choice, similarity for open-ended).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check that the dataset exists and is publicly accessible
2. Verify the field names match your prompt variables
3. Ensure you have sufficient permissions if using private datasets:
   - Check that your HuggingFace token is set correctly
   - Verify you're logged in with `huggingface-cli login`
   - Request access to the dataset if needed
4. Check the dataset documentation for specific configuration options
5. For large datasets, use the `limit` parameter to test your setup first
6. Verify that your prompts handle the dataset's specific format correctly
7. Review dataset-specific requirements (e.g., language codes, subsets)

### Common Issues

#### 401 Unauthorized

- Ensure `HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN` is set correctly
- Check if the dataset requires explicit access
- Try logging in via CLI: `huggingface-cli login`

#### Dataset Not Found

- Verify the dataset name and owner
- Check if the dataset is private
- Ensure you have the correct permissions

#### Invalid Configuration

- Check if the dataset supports the specified split
- Verify subset names are correct
- Ensure language codes are valid for multilingual datasets
