# What Are LLM Hallucinations and How to Detect Them

In February 2024, Air Canada learned an expensive lesson about AI reliability. Their customer service chatbot invented a bereavement fare policy that didn't exist, promising a customer they could retroactively apply for a discount. When the airline refused to honor the chatbot's promise, a tribunal ruled against them—Air Canada had to pay up for their AI's creative fiction.

This wasn't an isolated incident. That same year, Google's AI told users to eat rocks for their health and add glue to pizza for better cheese adhesion. Lawyers have been sanctioned for submitting AI-generated legal briefs citing cases that never existed. A Stanford study found that when asked about legal precedents, LLMs collectively invented over 120 non-existent court cases, complete with realistic-sounding names and detailed (but entirely fabricated) legal reasoning.

These aren't bugs—they're hallucinations, and they're one of the most significant challenges facing AI adoption in enterprise applications today.

## Understanding Hallucinations: When AI Makes Things Up

An LLM hallucination occurs when an AI model generates information that appears plausible but is factually incorrect, inconsistent, or completely fabricated. Think of it as the AI equivalent of confidently stating facts at a dinner party—except the AI is making them up on the spot.

Unlike human lies, hallucinations aren't intentional. They emerge from how LLMs work: these models are pattern-matching engines trained on vast amounts of text. They predict what words should come next based on patterns they've learned, not on verified facts or logical reasoning.

### Types of Hallucinations You'll Encounter

Understanding the different types of hallucinations is crucial for detecting and preventing them:

**Factual Inaccuracies**: The model states something demonstrably false. For example, claiming that Paris is the capital of Germany or that water boils at 50°C.

**Logical Inconsistencies**: The model contradicts itself within the same response. It might say a company was founded in 2020 in one paragraph, then reference its "25-year history" in the next.

**Fabricated Citations**: Perhaps the most insidious type—the model creates realistic-looking but non-existent sources. "According to Smith et al. (2019) in the Journal of Applied Computing..." sounds authoritative but may be completely invented.

**Temporal Confusion**: The model mixes up timelines or makes anachronistic statements, like discussing smartphones in the context of the 1950s.

**Self-Contradictions**: Within a conversation, the model may give different answers to the same question, each stated with equal confidence.

Here's a visual representation of how these hallucination types manifest:

## Why LLMs Hallucinate: The Root Causes

To effectively detect hallucinations, you need to understand why they happen in the first place.

### Training Data Limitations

LLMs learn from massive datasets scraped from the internet, books, and other sources. This data inevitably contains:

- Factual errors and outdated information
- Conflicting viewpoints presented as facts
- Satire and fiction mixed with factual content
- Biased or incomplete information

When an LLM encounters a query about something poorly represented in its training data, it doesn't say "I don't know"—it generates plausible-sounding text based on adjacent patterns it has learned.

### Pattern Matching vs. Understanding

LLMs are sophisticated pattern-matching systems, not reasoning engines. They excel at recognizing and reproducing linguistic patterns but lack true comprehension. When you ask an LLM about the population of a city, it's not consulting a database—it's generating text that statistically resembles accurate population statistics.

### Confidence Without Knowledge

Ironically, recent MIT research found that LLMs often use more confident language when hallucinating than when providing factual information. The model has learned that authoritative-sounding text patterns are common in its training data, so it reproduces this confidence even when fabricating information.

### Prompt Ambiguity

Vague or poorly constructed prompts increase hallucination risk. If you ask "Tell me about the treaty," without specifying which treaty, the model might confidently describe a treaty that's a composite of multiple real treaties—or entirely fictional.

### Context Window Effects

As conversations grow longer, LLMs can lose track of earlier context, leading to contradictions. They might "forget" facts established earlier in the conversation or introduce new information that conflicts with what they previously stated.

## Detection Methods: Your Hallucination Defense Toolkit

Now that we understand what hallucinations are and why they occur, let's explore practical methods to detect them. These techniques range from simple automated checks to sophisticated testing frameworks.

### Consistency Checking

One of the most effective detection methods is comparing multiple responses to the same query. Hallucinations often lack consistency—ask the same question five times, and you might get five different "facts."

Here's a simple Python implementation:

```python
def check_consistency(llm_client, prompt, n=5, threshold=0.8):
    """
    Check response consistency by generating multiple outputs
    Returns consistency score and flagged inconsistencies
    """
    responses = []
    for _ in range(n):
        response = llm_client.generate(prompt, temperature=0.7)
        responses.append(response)

    # Extract key facts from each response
    facts_per_response = [extract_facts(resp) for resp in responses]

    # Calculate consistency score
    common_facts = find_common_facts(facts_per_response)
    consistency_score = len(common_facts) / average_facts_count(facts_per_response)

    # Flag potential hallucinations
    inconsistent_facts = find_contradictions(facts_per_response)

    return {
        'consistency_score': consistency_score,
        'is_consistent': consistency_score >= threshold,
        'inconsistencies': inconsistent_facts,
        'responses': responses
    }
```

### Fact Verification

For factual claims, automated verification against trusted sources can catch many hallucinations:

```python
def verify_factual_claims(text, fact_checker_api):
    """
    Extract and verify factual claims from LLM output
    """
    # Extract claims that can be fact-checked
    claims = extract_verifiable_claims(text)

    verification_results = []
    for claim in claims:
        # Check against fact-checking API or database
        result = fact_checker_api.verify(claim)
        verification_results.append({
            'claim': claim,
            'verified': result.is_verified,
            'confidence': result.confidence,
            'sources': result.sources
        })

    # Calculate overall reliability score
    verified_count = sum(1 for r in verification_results if r['verified'])
    reliability_score = verified_count / len(claims) if claims else 1.0

    return {
        'reliability_score': reliability_score,
        'verification_results': verification_results
    }
```

### Source Attribution Analysis

When LLMs provide citations or quote sources, these can be automatically verified:

```python
def check_citations(text):
    """
    Verify citations and references in LLM output
    """
    citations = extract_citations(text)

    results = []
    for citation in citations:
        # Check if the cited work exists
        exists = verify_publication_exists(
            authors=citation.authors,
            title=citation.title,
            year=citation.year,
            journal=citation.journal
        )

        # If it exists, verify the quoted content
        if exists:
            content_match = verify_quoted_content(citation)
        else:
            content_match = False

        results.append({
            'citation': citation,
            'exists': exists,
            'content_verified': content_match
        })

    return results
```

### Confidence Scoring

Modern LLMs can provide token-level probabilities that indicate their confidence. Low-confidence tokens often correlate with hallucinations:

```python
def analyze_token_confidence(llm_output):
    """
    Analyze token-level confidence to identify potential hallucinations
    """
    tokens = llm_output.tokens
    probabilities = llm_output.token_probabilities

    # Flag tokens with low confidence
    low_confidence_threshold = 0.7
    suspicious_tokens = [
        (token, prob) for token, prob in zip(tokens, probabilities)
        if prob < low_confidence_threshold
    ]

    # Identify suspicious phrases (multiple low-confidence tokens)
    suspicious_phrases = find_suspicious_phrases(tokens, probabilities)

    return {
        'average_confidence': sum(probabilities) / len(probabilities),
        'suspicious_tokens': suspicious_tokens,
        'suspicious_phrases': suspicious_phrases
    }
```

## Practical Detection Tutorial with Promptfoo

Let's implement a comprehensive hallucination detection system using Promptfoo, which provides built-in capabilities for testing LLM outputs systematically.

### Setting Up Your Testing Framework

First, create a configuration file that defines your hallucination tests:

```yaml
# hallucination-tests.yaml
description: 'Hallucination detection test suite'

providers:
  - openai:gpt-4
  - anthropic:claude-3-sonnet

prompts:
  - |
    You are a helpful assistant. Answer the following question accurately.
    If you're not certain about something, say so.

    Question: {{question}}

tests:
  # Test 1: Known fact verification
  - vars:
      question: 'What is the capital of France?'
    assert:
      - type: contains
        value: 'Paris'
      - type: not-contains
        value: 'Lyon'
      - type: not-contains
        value: 'Marseille'

  # Test 2: Consistency check for numerical facts
  - vars:
      question: 'What is the population of Tokyo as of 2024?'
    assert:
      - type: llm-rubric
        value: |
          The response should acknowledge that exact current population 
          figures may vary but provide a reasonable estimate (35-40 million 
          for greater Tokyo area, 13-14 million for Tokyo city proper).
          Fail if wildly inaccurate numbers are given.
      - type: not-contains
        value: 'exactly' # Avoid false precision

  # Test 3: Citation hallucination check
  - vars:
      question: 'What research papers discuss the impact of transformers on NLP?'
    assert:
      - type: llm-rubric
        value: |
          Check that any cited papers actually exist. The response should 
          mention "Attention is All You Need" (Vaswani et al., 2017).
          Fail if fictional papers are cited with specific details.
      - type: javascript
        value: |
          // Check for suspiciously specific citations
          const citations = output.match(/\b\d{4}\b/g) || [];
          const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();
          const futureCitations = citations.filter(year => 
            parseInt(year) > currentYear
          );
          return futureCitations.length === 0;

  # Test 4: Self-consistency check
  - vars:
      question: 'Explain how photosynthesis works'
    assert:
      - type: similar
        value: 'Plants convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen'
        threshold: 0.8
      - type: llm-rubric
        value: |
          The explanation should be internally consistent. Check that 
          the same process isn't described differently within the response.
          Key elements (chlorophyll, light/dark reactions) should be 
          mentioned consistently if at all.

  # Test 5: Temporal accuracy
  - vars:
      question: 'What major events happened in 2023?'
    assert:
      - type: llm-rubric
        value: |
          Verify that events mentioned actually occurred in 2023.
          Common hallucinations include misdating events or creating
          plausible but fictional events. Be especially careful of
          specific dates and statistics.
      - type: not-contains-any
        value:
          - 'COVID-19 pandemic began' # Started in 2019/2020
          - 'World War' # No world wars in 2023
```

### Running Hallucination Detection Tests

Execute your test suite and analyze the results:

```bash
# Run the hallucination detection tests
promptfoo eval hallucination-tests.yaml

# Generate a detailed report
promptfoo eval hallucination-tests.yaml --output hallucination-report.html

# Run with multiple iterations for consistency checking
promptfoo eval hallucination-tests.yaml --repeat 5
```

### Advanced Hallucination Detection Patterns

For more sophisticated detection, combine multiple strategies:

```yaml
# advanced-hallucination-detection.yaml
providers:
  - id: openai:gpt-4
    config:
      temperature: 0.7

  - id: openai:gpt-4-turbo
    config:
      temperature: 0.3

defaultTest:
  assert:
    # Perplexity check - lower perplexity indicates higher confidence
    - type: perplexity
      threshold: 20 # Flag responses with perplexity > 20

    # Multi-model consistency
    - type: javascript
      value: |
        // Compare outputs across different models
        const outputs = context.getAllOutputs();
        const facts = outputs.map(extractKeyFacts);
        const commonFacts = findIntersection(facts);
        const consistencyRatio = commonFacts.length / averageFactCount(facts);
        return consistencyRatio > 0.75;

prompts:
  - |
    You are a fact-checking assistant. Your responses must be:
    1. Factually accurate
    2. Based on verifiable information
    3. Clear about uncertainty when appropriate

    {{question}}

    Important: If you're not certain about specific details, explicitly 
    state your level of confidence.

tests:
  # Medical hallucination detection
  - vars:
      question: 'What are the side effects of aspirin?'
    assert:
      - type: contains-any
        value:
          - 'blood thinning'
          - 'bleeding risk'
          - 'stomach irritation'
      - type: not-contains-any
        value:
          - 'cures cancer'
          - 'reverses aging'
          - 'enhances intelligence'
      - type: llm-rubric
        value: |
          Medical information must be accurate. Check for:
          1. Only mentioning established side effects
          2. Appropriate medical disclaimers
          3. No invention of rare or fictional side effects
          Score based on medical accuracy and responsible communication.

  # Financial hallucination detection
  - vars:
      question: "What was Apple's revenue in Q3 2023?"
    assert:
      - type: javascript
        value: |
          // Check for reasonable financial figures
          const numbers = output.match(/\$[\d.]+\s*(billion|million)/gi);
          if (!numbers) return false;

          // Apple's quarterly revenue is typically $80-120 billion
          const isReasonable = numbers.some(num => {
            const value = parseFloat(num.replace(/[^\d.]/g, ''));
            const isBillion = num.toLowerCase().includes('billion');
            const normalizedValue = isBillion ? value : value / 1000;
            return normalizedValue >= 70 && normalizedValue <= 130;
          });

          return isReasonable;
      - type: llm-rubric
        value: |
          Financial data should be accurate or clearly marked as estimates.
          Check for:
          1. Reasonable numbers for Apple's scale
          2. Appropriate disclaimers if exact figures aren't known
          3. No impossibly precise figures (like $94.836291 billion)
```

### Building a Continuous Monitoring Pipeline

For production applications, implement continuous hallucination monitoring:

```yaml
# production-monitoring.yaml
providers:
  - id: production-endpoint
    config:
      apiBaseUrl: https://api.yourcompany.com/llm

prompts:
  - file://prompts/production-prompt.txt

scenarios:
  - tests:
      - vars:
          user_query: '{{query}}'
        assert:
          # Real-time hallucination checks
          - type: webhook
            value: https://your-monitoring.com/hallucination-check

          # Confidence threshold
          - type: javascript
            value: |
              const confidence = output.metadata?.confidence || 0;
              return confidence > 0.85;

          # Fact verification service
          - type: webhook
            value: https://fact-checker.yourcompany.com/verify
            config:
              timeout: 5000
              expectedStatus: 200
# Run continuously with production traffic sampling
# promptfoo eval production-monitoring.yaml --watch --sample-rate 0.1
```

## Mitigation Strategies: Reducing Hallucination Risk

While detection is crucial, prevention is even better. Here are proven strategies to reduce hallucinations in your LLM applications:

### Prompt Engineering Techniques

Well-crafted prompts significantly reduce hallucination risk:

```python
# Bad prompt - vague and open to hallucination
bad_prompt = "Tell me about the company"

# Good prompt - specific and grounded
good_prompt = """
Based on the following company information, provide a summary:
Company Name: {company_name}
Industry: {industry}
Founded: {founded_year}

Please only include information that can be derived from the data provided.
If asked about information not provided, explicitly state that it's not available.
"""

# Better prompt - with explicit hallucination prevention
better_prompt = """
You are a financial analyst providing accurate information about {company_name}.

Guidelines:
1. Only state facts you are certain about
2. If unsure, say "I don't have confirmed information about..."
3. Do not invent statistics, dates, or figures
4. Cite the source of information when possible
5. Distinguish between facts and analysis/opinions

Question: {user_question}
"""
```

### RAG and Grounding

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can reduce hallucinations by 71% when properly implemented:

```python
def grounded_response(query, knowledge_base):
    """
    Generate response grounded in retrieved information
    """
    # Retrieve relevant documents
    relevant_docs = knowledge_base.search(query, top_k=5)

    # Build grounded prompt
    prompt = f"""
    Answer the following question based ONLY on the provided information.
    If the information doesn't contain the answer, say so clearly.

    Information:
    {format_documents(relevant_docs)}

    Question: {query}

    Instructions:
    - Only use facts from the provided information
    - Quote specific passages when making claims
    - If the answer isn't in the information, say "The provided information doesn't contain an answer to this question"
    """

    response = llm.generate(prompt)

    # Verify grounding
    verification = verify_grounding(response, relevant_docs)

    return {
        'response': response,
        'sources': relevant_docs,
        'grounding_score': verification['score']
    }
```

### Model Selection and Configuration

Choose models known for lower hallucination rates and configure them appropriately:

```yaml
# Model configuration for reduced hallucinations
providers:
  # Google's Gemini has low hallucination rates (0.7% in testing)
  - id: google:gemini-2.0-flash
    config:
      temperature: 0.3 # Lower temperature reduces creativity/hallucination
      topP: 0.9 # Moderate nucleus sampling

  # Use Claude for fact-checking due to Constitutional AI training
  - id: anthropic:claude-3-opus
    config:
      temperature: 0.2
      systemPrompt: |
        You are a fact-checking assistant. Always:
        1. Verify information before stating it
        2. Express uncertainty when appropriate
        3. Refuse to speculate on unknown information
```

### Output Validation and Filtering

Implement post-processing to catch and filter hallucinations:

```python
class HallucinationFilter:
    def __init__(self, threshold=0.8):
        self.threshold = threshold
        self.fact_checker = FactCheckingService()
        self.citation_validator = CitationValidator()

    def filter_response(self, response, context=None):
        """
        Filter and flag potential hallucinations in LLM response
        """
        # Extract claims
        claims = self.extract_claims(response)

        # Validate each claim
        validated_claims = []
        for claim in claims:
            validation = self.validate_claim(claim, context)
            if validation.confidence >= self.threshold:
                validated_claims.append(claim)
            else:
                # Flag or remove low-confidence claims
                claim.flagged = True
                claim.warning = f"Low confidence: {validation.confidence:.2f}"

        # Reconstruct response with validated claims
        filtered_response = self.reconstruct_response(
            response, validated_claims
        )

        # Add confidence indicators
        if any(claim.flagged for claim in validated_claims):
            filtered_response += "\n\nNote: Some claims could not be verified and have been flagged."

        return filtered_response
```

### User Interface Design

Design your UI to acknowledge and handle uncertainty:

```javascript
// React component showing confidence levels
function AIResponse({ response, confidence, sources }) {
  const getConfidenceColor = (level) => {
    if (level > 0.9) return 'green';
    if (level > 0.7) return 'yellow';
    return 'red';
  };

  return (
    <div className="ai-response">
      <div className="response-content">{response}</div>

      {confidence < 0.9 && (
        <div className="confidence-warning">
          <Icon type="warning" />
          Confidence: {(confidence * 100).toFixed(0)}%
          <Tooltip>This response has moderate confidence. Some details may be uncertain.</Tooltip>
        </div>
      )}

      {sources && sources.length > 0 && (
        <div className="sources">
          <h4>Sources:</h4>
          {sources.map((source, idx) => (
            <Citation key={idx} source={source} />
          ))}
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Confidence Indicators

Always communicate uncertainty to users:

```python
def add_confidence_indicators(response, confidence_scores):
    """
    Add visual and textual confidence indicators to response
    """
    if confidence_scores['overall'] < 0.7:
        response = f"⚠️ Low confidence response:\n{response}"
    elif confidence_scores['overall'] < 0.9:
        response = f"ℹ️ Moderate confidence:\n{response}"

    # Add specific uncertainties
    uncertainties = []
    for claim, score in confidence_scores['claims'].items():
        if score < 0.8:
            uncertainties.append(f"- {claim}: {score:.0%} confident")

    if uncertainties:
        response += "\n\nUncertain claims:\n" + "\n".join(uncertainties)

    return response
```

## Best Practices for Production Systems

Implementing hallucination detection in production requires a systematic approach:

### Testing Strategy

Create comprehensive test suites that cover various hallucination scenarios:

```yaml
# Comprehensive hallucination test strategy
test_suites:
  - name: 'Factual Accuracy'
    tests:
      - historical_events
      - scientific_facts
      - geographical_information
      - current_events

  - name: 'Consistency Checks'
    tests:
      - multi_response_consistency
      - temporal_consistency
      - logical_consistency

  - name: 'Citation Validation'
    tests:
      - academic_citations
      - news_sources
      - statistical_claims

  - name: 'Domain-Specific'
    tests:
      - medical_information
      - legal_precedents
      - financial_data

  - name: 'Edge Cases'
    tests:
      - ambiguous_queries
      - future_predictions
      - hypothetical_scenarios
```

### Monitoring in Production

Implement real-time monitoring for hallucination patterns:

```python
class HallucinationMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.metrics = MetricsCollector()
        self.alerting = AlertingSystem()

    def monitor_response(self, request, response, metadata):
        """
        Monitor LLM responses for hallucination indicators
        """
        # Calculate hallucination risk score
        risk_score = self.calculate_risk_score(response, metadata)

        # Record metrics
        self.metrics.record({
            'hallucination_risk': risk_score,
            'confidence': metadata.get('confidence', 0),
            'response_length': len(response),
            'model': metadata.get('model'),
            'timestamp': datetime.now()
        })

        # Alert on high-risk responses
        if risk_score > 0.8:
            self.alerting.send_alert({
                'type': 'high_hallucination_risk',
                'risk_score': risk_score,
                'request': request,
                'response': response[:500],  # Truncated
                'action_required': 'manual_review'
            })

        # Sample for quality assurance
        if random.random() < 0.05:  # 5% sampling
            self.queue_for_human_review(request, response, risk_score)

        return risk_score
```

### User Education

Educate users about AI limitations and how to spot potential hallucinations:

```markdown
## AI Assistant Guidelines

This AI assistant is designed to help you, but it has limitations:

✅ **Strengths:**

- General knowledge and explanations
- Creative brainstorming
- Language tasks

⚠️ **Limitations:**

- May occasionally generate incorrect information
- Cannot access real-time data
- May be inconsistent across responses

🔍 **How to verify information:**

1. Check important facts with authoritative sources
2. Be skeptical of highly specific claims (dates, statistics)
3. Ask for sources when accuracy matters
4. Use the confidence indicators provided

🚫 **Never rely solely on AI for:**

- Medical diagnoses or treatment
- Legal advice
- Financial decisions
- Safety-critical information
```

### Graceful Degradation

When hallucinations are detected, handle them gracefully:

```python
def handle_hallucination_detection(response, hallucination_score):
    """
    Gracefully handle detected hallucinations
    """
    if hallucination_score > 0.9:
        # High risk - provide alternative
        return {
            'status': 'high_risk',
            'message': "I'm not confident about this response. Let me try a different approach...",
            'action': 'regenerate_with_stricter_prompt'
        }

    elif hallucination_score > 0.7:
        # Moderate risk - add warnings
        return {
            'status': 'moderate_risk',
            'response': response,
            'warning': "This response may contain uncertainties. Please verify important information.",
            'confidence_areas': identify_low_confidence_sections(response)
        }

    else:
        # Low risk - proceed normally
        return {
            'status': 'ok',
            'response': response
        }
```

### Documentation and Training

Maintain comprehensive documentation for your team:

```markdown
# Hallucination Detection Playbook

## Quick Reference

### Severity Levels

- **Critical**: Medical, legal, or financial hallucinations
- **High**: Factual errors in important contexts
- **Medium**: Minor inconsistencies or uncertain claims
- **Low**: Stylistic variations or subjective statements

### Response Protocol

1. **Critical**: Block response, alert on-call engineer
2. **High**: Add prominent warning, log for review
3. **Medium**: Add confidence indicator, monitor patterns
4. **Low**: Log for analysis, no user-facing action

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run consistency tests (5+ iterations)
- [ ] Verify all citations and sources
- [ ] Check numerical claims against bounds
- [ ] Test with adversarial prompts
- [ ] Validate domain-specific accuracy
```

## Conclusion

LLM hallucinations aren't just a technical curiosity—they're a critical challenge that can impact user trust, cause financial losses, and even pose safety risks. As we've seen from Air Canada's costly chatbot mistake to lawyers facing sanctions for AI-generated legal fiction, the consequences of unchecked hallucinations are real and growing.

The good news is that with the right combination of detection methods, testing strategies, and preventive measures, you can significantly reduce hallucination risks in your LLM applications. By implementing consistency checking, fact verification, and comprehensive testing frameworks like Promptfoo, you can catch hallucinations before they reach your users.
