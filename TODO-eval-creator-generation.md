  - [x] Visual indicators for generated assertions

### 2.2 Server Routes

- [x] Create `/api/assertions/generate` endpoint
  - [x] Implement assertion synthesis integration
  - [x] Support async job pattern
  - [x] Add proper validation and error handling
  - [x] Support different assertion types

- [x] Update `src/server/routes/generate.ts`
  - [x] Add assertion generation handler
  - [x] Reuse job infrastructure from dataset generation

### 2.3 Integration

- [x] Extend generation service for assertions
  - [x] API client methods for assertion generation
  - [x] Type definitions for assertion generation options
  - [x] Progress tracking

## Phase 3: Polish & Enhancements (Priority 3)

### 3.1 User Experience

- [ ] Add generation templates
  - [ ] Common testing scenarios (QA, safety, performance)
  - [ ] Industry-specific templates
  - [ ] Custom template creation

- [ ] Improve generation preview
  - [ ] Show estimated time for generation
  - [ ] Preview generated persona types
  - [ ] Cost estimation (if applicable)

### 3.2 Advanced Features

- [ ] Batch operations
  - [ ] Generate assertions for multiple test cases
  - [ ] Bulk regeneration with different settings
  - [ ] Export/import generation settings

- [ ] Generation history
  - [ ] Track all generation operations
  - [ ] Allow reverting to previous generations
  - [ ] Generation analytics

### 3.3 Performance & Reliability

- [ ] Add caching layer
  - [ ] Cache generation results
  - [ ] Implement cache invalidation
  - [ ] Offline generation queue

- [ ] Rate limiting
  - [ ] Client-side request throttling
  - [ ] Server-side rate limits
  - [ ] Graceful degradation

## Technical Debt & Refactoring

### Code Quality

- [ ] Add comprehensive tests
  - [ ] Unit tests for generation components
  - [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints
  - [ ] E2E tests for generation workflows

- [ ] Documentation
  - [ ] API documentation for new endpoints
  - [ ] Component documentation
  - [ ] User guide for generation features

### Refactoring Opportunities

- [ ] Extract common generation UI patterns
- [ ] Create shared generation utilities
- [ ] Standardize error handling across generation features

## Implementation Order

1. **Week 1-2**: Phase 1.1 & 1.2 (Basic dataset generation)
2. **Week 3**: Phase 1.3 & 1.4 (State management and integration)
3. **Week 4-5**: Phase 2.1 & 2.2 (Assertion generation)
4. **Week 6**: Phase 2.3 & initial testing
5. **Week 7-8**: Phase 3 (Polish and enhancements)
6. **Week 9**: Documentation and testing

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Users can generate test cases with < 3 clicks
- [ ] Generation completes within reasonable time (< 30s for typical use)
- [ ] Generated content quality matches or exceeds manual creation
- [ ] No regression in existing eval creator functionality
- [ ] Positive user feedback on generation features

## Completed Enhancements (2025-07-13)

### Visual Indicators

- [x] Added visual indicators for generated test cases using metadata tracking
  - Test cases generated via GenerateTestCasesDialog now have metadata with isGenerated flag
  - TestCasesSection displays "Generated" chip with AutoAwesome icon
  - Metadata includes generation timestamp, provider, and options used
- [x] Added visual indicators for generated assertions
  - AssertsForm tracks which assertions were generated
  - Shows "Generated" chip next to generated assertions
  - Maintains tracking when assertions are removed

### Next Priority Tasks

1. **Generation History Tracking**
   - Store generation history in evalConfig store
   - Allow viewing past generations
   - Support regenerating with same settings

2. **Batch Assertion Generation**
   - Update GenerateAssertionsDialog to support multiple test case selection
   - Modify API to handle batch generation
   - Show progress for each test case

3. **Generation Templates/Presets**
   - Create preset generation configurations
   - Allow saving custom templates
   - Quick-apply common patterns

4. **Improved UX**
   - Add preview/review step before applying generated content
   - Support selective application of generated items
   - Add regeneration capability with modified settings

## Open Questions

1. Should we support custom generation prompts/templates?
2. How to handle provider API key management for generation?
3. ~~Should generated content be marked/tagged differently?~~ âœ“ Implemented
4. What are the rate limits we should impose?
5. Should we support generation history export/import?

## Dependencies

- Existing synthesis functions work correctly
- Provider infrastructure supports generation use cases
- Job queue system can handle generation workloads
- UI state management can handle async operations

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Provider Failures**: Implement retry logic and fallback providers
2. **Long Generation Times**: Add progress indicators and cancellation
3. **Poor Quality Output**: Allow regeneration and manual editing
4. **State Corruption**: Implement proper error boundaries and recovery
5. **API Rate Limits**: Add client-side throttling and queueing
