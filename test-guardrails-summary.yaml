# What we learned:
# 1. ✅ Redteam mode detection works correctly
# 2. ✅ Our code correctly checks for content_filter and content_policy_violation
# 3. ❌ The test prompts don't actually trigger OpenAI's content filters
# 4. The models are returning polite refusals with finish_reason: 'stop'
#
# To actually see guardrails in action, we would need prompts that cause:
# - OpenAI to return finish_reason: 'content_filter' 
# - OpenAI to return a 400 error with code: 'content_policy_violation'
#
# These signals are real (confirmed by existing Azure provider code and 
# online documentation) but are difficult to trigger consistently.
