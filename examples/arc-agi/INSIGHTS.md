# ARC-AGI Evaluation Insights

## Key Findings

### 1. Model Performance on ARC-AGI

From our initial tests:
- Current language models struggle with even simple ARC-AGI tasks
- Models can identify that patterns exist but often fail to apply them correctly
- The grid transformation from 3x3 to 9x9 pattern proved challenging for both Claude and GPT-4

### UPDATE: Python Code Execution Works!
- When prompted clearly, models can write correct Python functions
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet successfully solved the color-filling pattern
- Actual code execution validates whether models truly understand the pattern
- This approach is more reliable than asking for direct grid outputs

### 2. Evaluation Strategies

We implemented three main strategies:
- **Direct Prompting**: Simple but limited effectiveness
- **Chain-of-Thought**: Helps models explain reasoning but doesn't guarantee correct solutions
- **Program Synthesis**: Promising approach where models write code to solve tasks

### 3. promptfoo Benefits for ARC-AGI

- **Systematic Comparison**: Easy to compare multiple models on the same tasks
- **Custom Evaluators**: Pixel-perfect accuracy checking is essential for ARC-AGI
- **Flexible Test Format**: Can handle both JSON task files and inline test definitions
- **Performance Metrics**: Token usage and timing help understand cost/efficiency tradeoffs

## Best Practices

### 1. Task Selection
- Start with simpler patterns to establish baselines
- Include tasks that test different cognitive abilities
- Use both training and evaluation sets

### 2. Prompt Engineering
- Clear color mappings are essential (0=Black, 1=Blue, etc.)
- Structured output formats (JSON) improve parsing reliability
- Few-shot examples help but aren't sufficient for complex patterns

### 3. Evaluation Metrics
- **Pixel Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly predicted pixels
- **Perfect Matches**: Binary success metric (100% correct or not)
- **Cost per Task**: Important for comparing approaches

## Future Improvements

### 1. Advanced Strategies
- Test-time training simulation
- Ensemble methods combining multiple approaches
- Integration with specialized ARC solvers

### 2. ARC-AGI-3 Integration
- Real-time game agent evaluation
- Multi-turn reasoning with state tracking
- Performance across different game types

### 3. Visualization
- Grid visualization in promptfoo UI
- Side-by-side comparison of expected vs predicted outputs
- Pattern analysis tools

## Conclusion

promptfoo provides an excellent framework for evaluating AI models on ARC-AGI tasks. While current models struggle with these tasks, the systematic evaluation approach helps identify strengths and weaknesses, guiding future improvements in AGI development.

The combination of:
- Multiple evaluation strategies
- Custom accuracy metrics
- Easy model comparison
- Comprehensive test management

Makes promptfoo a valuable tool for ARC-AGI research and development.
