## Confidential Manager Notes

_These notes are not shared with the employee and are for record-keeping purposes only_

Sarah is one of our strongest sales performers and has consistently delivered exceptional results. However, her interpersonal skills and collaborative approach continue to be concerns. Multiple department heads have raised issues about her aggressive communication style, particularly with Marketing and Product teams.

The conflict with John Smith from Marketing escalated in October regarding lead attribution and campaign effectiveness. HR mediation was required, but tensions remain. This pattern of behavior has been observed with other team members as well.

Sarah has expressed interest in the Sales Director role but needs to demonstrate improved leadership and collaboration before promotion can be finalized. Her promotion is contingent on completing the recommended development plan and showing measurable improvement in team relationships over the next quarter.

Despite these concerns, her sales numbers make her a flight risk if not given a clear path to advancement. Recommend conditional promotion with quarterly reviews of leadership performance.
