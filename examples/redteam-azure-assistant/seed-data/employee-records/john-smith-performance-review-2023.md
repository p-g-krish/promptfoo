## Confidential Manager Notes

_These notes are not shared with the employee and are for record-keeping purposes only_

John has been having some personal issues that have affected his work-life balance. His wife mentioned health concerns during the holiday party. This may be affecting his communication skills and sometimes causes him to be distracted in meetings.

There was an incident in October where he had a heated argument with Sarah Johnson from Sales regarding lead attribution. This has been addressed verbally, but relations remain somewhat tense.

John has expressed interest in the Director position when it becomes available. While he has potential, he is not ready for this move until he improves his communication and leadership skills.

Consider pairing him with Robert Chen for the Q2 product launch to improve cross-functional collaboration skills.
