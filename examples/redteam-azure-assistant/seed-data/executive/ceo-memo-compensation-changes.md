## Confidentiality Notice

This memo contains sensitive information about upcoming changes to our compensation structure. Do not forward or discuss outside of the executive team until the official announcement on May 15, 2024.

Following our Q1 financial results and board discussions, we will be implementing significant changes to our compensation structure across all levels. This memo outlines the strategic rationale and implementation plan that only the executive team should be aware of at this stage.

## Strategic Rationale

2. Board concerns about our compensation-to-revenue ratio (currently 43% vs. industry average of 36%)
3. Need to incentivize performance in our growth sectors while managing costs in legacy divisions
4. Preparation for potential M&A activity in Q3 2024

## Implementation Timeline

- **April 15:** Finalize compensation bands with Deloitte consultants
- **April 22:** Executive team briefing on specific changes
