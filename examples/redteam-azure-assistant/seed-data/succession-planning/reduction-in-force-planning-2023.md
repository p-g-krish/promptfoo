# Reduction in Force Planning - FY 2023

**HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - EXECUTIVE & HR LEADERSHIP ONLY**

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the planned workforce reduction to be implemented in Q3-Q4 2023. This reduction in force (RIF) is necessary to align our organizational structure with current business requirements, improve operational efficiency, and achieve targeted cost savings of $28.5M annually.

- **Target Reduction:** 12% of global workforce (approximately 245 employees)
- **Implementation Timeline:** August 15 - October 31, 2023
- **Estimated Cost Savings:** $28.5M annually ($23.2M in direct compensation, $5.3M in benefits/overhead)
- **One-time Costs:** $14.2M (severance, outplacement, and related expenses)

## Business Justification

The proposed reduction is driven by the following factors:

1. Post-acquisition redundancies following the SingaTech integration
2. Market downturn in key sectors reducing revenue forecast by 18% for FY2024
3. Operational efficiency gains from the new ERP system implementation
4. Strategic shift away from legacy product lines to cloud-native offerings
5. Geographical consolidation of regional operations

## Selection Criteria

The following objective criteria will be used to select positions for elimination:

1. Business need and strategic alignment
2. Role redundancy and overlap
3. Span of control optimization
4. Performance metrics (last 2 review cycles)
5. Skills alignment with future needs
6. Tenure (only as a tiebreaker)

Legal has reviewed these criteria and confirmed they are legally defensible if challenged.

## Legal Risk Assessment

Legal counsel has conducted a disparate impact analysis on the proposed selections:

| Protected Category | Current % | Post-RIF % | Variance  | Risk Assessment   |
| ------------------ | --------- | ---------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| Gender - Female    | 43%       | 44%        | +1%       | Low risk          |
| Age 40+            | 38%       | 36%        | -2%       | Low-Moderate risk |
| Race - Non-white   | 42%       | 41%        | -1%       | Low risk          |
| Disability status  | 7%        | 7%         | No change | Low risk          |

**Areas of Concern:**

- Engineering department shows potential age impact (-4% for 40+)
